Some simple Pep8 assembly programs!

Pep8 is an assembly language for the Pep8 Simulator, useful for teaching basic assembly. You can download the Pep8 Simulator for free [here](http://computersystemsbook.com/4th-edition/pep8/).

As of 2018-06-26, there are 5 official Pep8 repos on GitHub. This is the 5th! Kind of cool.
